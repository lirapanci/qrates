# qrates wordpress theme


This is a project that I worked to practice my CSS/HTML/JS and WP theme development skills. The design is from [Frontend Practice Project](https://www.frontendpractice.com/projects/qrates).

[Demo URL](https://qrates-demo.aglipanci.com/)

I have built the project using Advanced Custom Field PRO (ACF), specifically [Flexible Content](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/flexible-content/), in order to create a block-based editor, for easy-management and the ability to reuse the components as much as possible.

Libraries, Plugins and Frameworks used:

- [SwiperJs](https://swiperjs.com/) 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Advanced Custom Fields PRO](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/) 
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
